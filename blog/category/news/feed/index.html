				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s amazing what you can make during 30 hours… and the teams at Hackagong 2015 boasted their ability to do just that. We awarded over $150,000 worth of prizes and giveaways at this year’s Hackagong held 19-20 September 2015 at the University of Wollongong. This year was our biggest yet, selling out at 160 tickets with competitors spanning out across 49 teams competing for 13 different prize categories. We also introduced Australia&#8217;s first hackathon crowdfunding experiment, with 9 teams creating crowdfunding campaigns. Thus far, over $4000 has been raised by teams. Our category prizes ranged from Most Innovative 3D Printed Object to Best Internet of Things Hack to the Community and Social Impact prize!</p>
<p dir="ltr">After 30 hours full of designing, coding, building, hacking and eating the teams produced truly awesome prototypes ready for judging by our team of category judges. Teams competing for the overall prize prepared crowdfunding campaigns to market their product to the world with the winner being determined at Demo Day &#8211; our Top 6 pitching event on 2nd October 2015. The Top 6 teams were determined by a combination of the amount of money raised and the amount of backers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>THE HACKAGONG OVERALL WINNER IS… THE LOCATIONISER!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Locationiser (Alex Gray and Antonin Ganner) is a device designed to scan a room from a single point and gain precise measurements, to display in as 3D blueprints. A hugely useful tool for engineers and architects working in existing spaces and other applications as well. The team utilised a number of different technologies such as IoT, 3D Printing and LIDAR to bring together their idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alex and Antonin have won an amazing prize package worth over $52,000 including $5000 cash (WiseTech Global) + Business Mentoring (Liquid Co) + Web Hosting (Rackspace) + Coworking Desks (iAccelerate) + ACS Memberships and Flights to Melbourne to meet the Liquid Co team. The prize package will enable the team to kickstart their prototype into a fully fledged product.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you’re interested in checking out The Locationiser, you can checkout their DevPost submission here:<a href="http://devpost.com/software/the-locationiser" rel="nofollow">http://devpost.com/software/the-locationiser</a> &#8211; Otherwise, you can support The Locationiser by heading to their crowdfunding campaign website: <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-locationiser#/" rel="nofollow">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-locationiser#</a></p>

You can secure your spot here: <a href="http://hack3dw2.eventbrite.com.au" target="_blank">http://hack3dw2.eventbrite.com.au</a></p>
<p>In this workshop, we will be demonstrating how to create and prepare a 3D model for printing. We&#8217;ll kindly ask all participants to bring along a laptop with 123D Design software downloaded and ready to go. The 123D Design software is free from Autodesk and can be downloaded from their website (link below). Our Build Ambassador Cameron will give an overview of the software and helpers will be available throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>Download software here: <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/design" target="_blank">http://www.123dapp.com/design</a></p>
<p>Note: There will only be a small opportunity at the beginning of the workshop to prepare the 123D Design software, however, we highly recommend pre-downloading the software as no public wifi is available.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing everyone there! If you have any questions, please ask us on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackagong" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we hosted a Meta workshop for those interested in the technology. Hosts from Meta: Esther Lekeu and Brennan Hatton gave a fantastic demonstration on what the Meta 1 Developer Kit is and how to start developing for the Meta 1 Developer Kit platform. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Meta before, it&#8217;s a augmented reality platform which combines the real world with the virtual world. Unlike the Oculus Rift which is completely virtual, Meta is transparent, you can still see the real world but it has virtual objects rendered into view.</p>
<p><a href="https://hackagong.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/meta-9.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1182"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1182" src="https://159.203.208.10/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/meta-9-1024x682.jpg" alt="meta-9" width="640" height="426" /></a></p>
<p>The Meta 1 Dev Kit is currently sold out until August 2015, but luckily Hackagong will have four kits to use on the weekend. Hackagong is proud to announce that we will be the first public hackathon in Australia that has access to the Meta technology! Pretty awesome eh?</p>
<p>Thanks to the guys at Meta, we also have one Meta 1 Developer Kit to giveaway to the team that makes the best application for the Meta 1. Unfortunately, there will be limited Meta 1 Development Kits available on the day and you must first pitch your idea to the Meta team. If you&#8217;re interested in using a Meta 1 Development Kit during Hackagong, please get in touch with Brennan Hatton. You&#8217;ll be requested to pitch your idea to him over a Skype call. Only a select number of teams will get the opportunity to use Meta over the weekend, so it&#8217;s important to get your pitch to Brennan quickly. You&#8217;ll also need to make sure your computer has the minimum requirements to run the Meta software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity3D 4.6.0b20: <a href="https://meta-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/UnitySetup_update-4.6.0b20.exe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">Download Here</a></li>
<li>Windows 7 / 8</li>
<li>i5, 4GB ram</li>
<li>1 USB port</li>
<li>1 HDMI port or HDMI adapter</li>
</ul>
<p>More information can be found about Meta on their website: <a href="http://getameta.com/" target="_blank">http://getameta.com/</a>. Teams will also have the chance to enter the exclusive Meta Pioneers Program: <a href="https://www.spaceglasses.com/pioneers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">https://www.spaceglasses.com/pioneers</a></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to tonight&#8217;s workshop and a huge thanks to Meta for running the program plus providing the development gear for the weekend.</p>

<p>Well that was a truly epic week in Wollongong!</p>
<p>We awarded over $32,000 in prizes at last weekend&#8217;s Hackagong held July 20-21, 2013 at the UOW uniCentre, and <a href="http://demodayaus.com" target="_blank">Demo Day</a> held Wednesday July 24, 2013 at the WIN Entertainment Centre. Hackagong attracted over 100 competitors across 34 teams, competing across 9 different category competitions from game development to 3D printing, and over 150 people were in attendance during the weekend. Some teams traveled from as far away as Canberra and Melbourne to compete!</p>
<p>After 30 hours of design, code, build &amp; launch (and little sleep) all competitors produced truly spectacular prototypes, and an amazing group of judges decided all of the <a title="Hackagong 2013 Category Prize Winners Announced" href="https://hackagong.com/blog/hackagong-2013-category-prize-winners-announced/">category prize winners</a> including the <a title="Top 10 Hackagong teams pitching tomorrow for the Major Prize!" href="https://hackagong.com/blog/top-10-hackagong-teams-pitching-tomorrow-for-the-major-prize/">Top 10 teams</a>.</p>
