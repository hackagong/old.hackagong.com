<th>This weekend, I bussed down to the coast from Sydney / Wollongong on “The Innovation Bus” with a bunch of Sydney / Wollongong Hackers.<br />
Which was really just a bunch of devs, hustlers &amp; artists talking philosophy, drinking beer &amp; playing Space-Team. Kinda like a holiday with hackers. A holiday hackathon &#8211; Holathon? Hackiday?

<p>So for those of you who dont know..</p>

<p>Bega is here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a lot of people, travelling that far for a hackathon in a place that doesnt sound too techy seems like a lot of effort. What could be down there?</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Did you hack cheese?</h1>
<p><img src="https://www.siliconvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bega.jpg" alt="bega" /></p>
<p>Okay, congrats. You made the connection between Bega cheese, and the town. Very funny. There is actually a lot more to Bega than the cheese.</p>
<p>Did you know Bega is actually surrounded by some of the most beautiful land in Australia?</p>
<p>Did you know Bega has some of the best, and most un-used surfbreaks in the world?</p>
<p>Bega is that part of Australia where that amazing stereotype foreigners like to put on us comes to life! Where everyone surfs, the weather is amazing, the beaches are literally perfect, the locals are friendlier than Canadians and the wildlife is everywhere.</p>

<p>Hackathon or no, if you haven&#8217;t been to Bega, make sure you change that.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Wait, you said BioHackers!?</h1>
<p>No, they didnt make cows with chocolate milk.</p>
<p>They actually brought power-tools, tin cans, tubes, large syringes, giant glowy mushrooms and DIY&#8217;ed the shit out of bioHacking. Their DIY Bioreactor automates the culturing of microbes for the production of secondary metabolites, proteins and other things. Which they are currently adapting to grow algae and sea monkeys. They weren&#8217;t the only abnormally impressive people there.</p>
<p>Before the pitches started, my team was fairly confident we had a potentially winning hack with <a href="www.siliconvagabond.com/castle-rush/">our beautiful Virtual Reality &amp; BuzzyTV game</a> that could be placed in venues to engage customers, keeping them around for longer.</p>
<p>But that confidence was squashed with each and ever pitch, getting more and more competitive.</p>
<p>A local startup was reinventing data connectivity with mesh networks for rural areas just outside of the NBN or other connections.</p>
<p>Chat-bots were designed for Facebook&#8217;s new messenger service to provide train times.</p>
<p>Apps designed to warn you of dangers to your pets. Notify the councils of pot holes, or crowd-source rural transportation.</p>
<p>Lochuallan, a kid who couldn&#8217;t have been more than 14, teamed up with a local hacker Isaac to build a wifi enabled LAZER tag. They used small personal battery powered wifi nodes, communicating on a mesh network designed by another participants startup, to communicate the received shots made by their hacked wii remotes used as laser tag guns.</p>
<p>I have travelled around the world, attending, sponsoring and running hackthons from France to London, Berlin, Auckland, Amsterdam, Sydney &amp; Brisbane. Hackathons with up to 2000 people in the US, San Fransisco, New York, Silicon Valley, Berkeley, Michigan &amp; Denver. But I never would have thought that Bega, a small town in rural Australia could put on one of the most enjoyable hackathons I&#8217;ve ever attended.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">It’s amazing what you can make during 30 hours… and the teams at Hackagong 2015 boasted their ability to do just that. We awarded over $150,000 worth of prizes and giveaways at this year’s Hackagong held 19-20 September 2015 at the University of Wollongong. This year was our biggest yet, selling out at 160 tickets with competitors spanning out across 49 teams competing for 13 different prize categories. We also introduced Australia&#8217;s first hackathon crowdfunding experiment, with 9 teams creating crowdfunding campaigns. Thus far, over $4000 has been raised by teams. Our category prizes ranged from Most Innovative 3D Printed Object to Best Internet of Things Hack to the Community and Social Impact prize!</p>
<p dir="ltr">After 30 hours full of designing, coding, building, hacking and eating the teams produced truly awesome prototypes ready for judging by our team of category judges. Teams competing for the overall prize prepared crowdfunding campaigns to market their product to the world with the winner being determined at Demo Day &#8211; our Top 6 pitching event on 2nd October 2015. The Top 6 teams were determined by a combination of the amount of money raised and the amount of backers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>THE HACKAGONG OVERALL WINNER IS… THE LOCATIONISER!</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Locationiser (Alex Gray and Antonin Ganner) is a device designed to scan a room from a single point and gain precise measurements, to display in as 3D blueprints. A hugely useful tool for engineers and architects working in existing spaces and other applications as well. The team utilised a number of different technologies such as IoT, 3D Printing and LIDAR to bring together their idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alex and Antonin have won an amazing prize package worth over $52,000 including $5000 cash (WiseTech Global) + Business Mentoring (Liquid Co) + Web Hosting (Rackspace) + Coworking Desks (iAccelerate) + ACS Memberships and Flights to Melbourne to meet the Liquid Co team. The prize package will enable the team to kickstart their prototype into a fully fledged product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sponsors are a huge part of Hackagong. Without the generous contributions from our sponsors, we wouldn&#8217;t be running this awesome Hackathon! This is Sponsor Watch, where we take a quick look at one of our sponsors.</p>
<p><b>Company:</b> <span>Commonwealth Bank</span><br />
<strong>Company Website:</strong> <span><a class="in-cell-link" href="http://Commbank.com.au/careers" target="_blank">Commbank.com.au/careers</a></span><br />
<strong>Location:</strong> <span>Our head office is in Sydney, but we have offices all around the globe – in Asia, Europe, the United States and South Africa.</span><br />
<strong>Number of Employees:</strong> <span>52,000</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What does your company do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We are Australia’s leading provider of financial services including retail, premium, business and institutional banking, funds management, superannuation, insurance, investment and share-broking products and services. The Group is one of the largest listed companies on the Australian Securities Exchange and is included in the Morgan Stanley Capital Global Index. With customers at the heart of everything we do, we’re focused on helping people and businesses move forward financially. We are driven to deliver seamless experiences, in smart, innovative ways.</span></p>
<p>A workplace of the future, our 52,000 people are able to bring their different backgrounds and unique perspectives to our collaborative environment, and are supported to share ideas, initiatives, talent and energy – making a positive impact on colleagues, customers and our business. It’s what makes CommBank a place of opportunity, where your skills can take you in unexpected directions and you can achieve great things.</p>
<p><span><strong>How did your company first get started? </strong><strong>What&#8217;s the origin story?</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Australia’s first banks were established early in the 19th century, either as private companies or as partnerships. Government banks, created and guaranteed by colonial (later state) governments, were established to promote land settlement and rural development, and to accept savings deposits.</span></p>
<p>It was in this tradition that, in 1911 (a decade after the Australian Colonies federated), Andrew Fisher’s Labor Government decided to establish a government bank for the newly formed nation. Over the years, many State Government banks established in the 19th century were amalgamated into the Commonwealth Bank, most recently the State Bank of Victoria (1990) and, via the Colonial merger in 2000, the Rural Bank successor to the (Government) Savings Bank of NSW.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve grown to a business with more than 800,000 shareholders and 52,000 people working in the Commonwealth Bank Group. We are recognised as leading the industry in IT and operations, thanks to our world-class platforms and processes, agile IT infrastructure, and innovation in everything from customer payments, to internet banking and mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you sponsor Hackagong 2015?</strong></p>
<p><span>At CommBank, our Digital and Enterprise Services teams drive the digital experience for more than 14.5 million customers across Australia and the world who rely on us for a seamless banking experience.</span></p>
<p>We are a fast growing team with the opportunity to shape the way Commonwealth Bank serves customers digitally and beyond and we’re looking for switched on, ambitious innovative thinkers to join us and help engineer the future of banking.</p>
<p><strong>Has your company ever held internal hackathons?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, we have held a number of hackathons over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is the most awesome thing or project your company has done?</strong></p>
<p><span>We have a long and proud history of delivering innovative solutions to our customers. Take a look back at the many other ways we have been at the forefront of technological development since opening our doors in 1912 in this short video. </span></p>
<p><iframe width="848" height="477" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZorLkdW1rww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to at Hackagong 2015?</strong></p>
<p><span>Seeing what the innovative and talented software engineers from UoW can build.</span></p>
<p><strong>Are you currently hiring and if so, what type of person are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p><span>You are an innovative thinker, happy to take the initiative, a driver of change, dedicated to creating a better experience for our customers; passionate about technology, the simplification of processes and organisational change.</span></p>
<p>We have a wide range of opportunities from software engineers and UX designers to cyber security experts and digital producers.</p>
<p>Hackagong and WITS thanks Commonwealth Bank for supporting our event! Without them Hackagong would not be possible.</p>

<p><b>Company:</b> Atlassian<br />
<strong>Company Website:</strong> www.atlassian.com<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> <span>Sydney. George Street, overlooking Martin Place. We are located in 14 cities globally. </span><br />
<strong>Number of Employees: </strong>O<span>ver 1800 globally</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What does your company do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Software is changing the world, and we’re at the center of it all. With more than 40,000 global customers (including 85 of the Fortune 100) and a highly disruptive business model, we’re advancing the art of team collaboration with products like JIRA, Confluence and HipChat–and we’re just getting started. Driven by honest values, an amazing culture, and consistent revenue growth, we’re out to unleash the potential of every team. From Amsterdam and Austin to Sydney and San Francisco, we’re looking for people who are powered by passion and eager to do the best work of their lives in a highly autonomous yet collaborative, no B.S. environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did your company first get started? </strong><strong>What&#8217;s the origin story?</strong></p>
<p><span>In 2002, our founders, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, set conventional wisdom on its ear by launching a successful enterprise software company with no sales force. From Australia. Our first product, JIRA, proved that if you make a great piece of software, price it right, and make it available to anyone to download from the internet, teams will come. And they&#8217;ll build great things with it. And they&#8217;ll tell two friends, and so on, and so on.</span></p>
<p><strong>Has your company ever held internal hackathons?</strong></p>
<p><span>Quarterly, Atlassian gives employees 24 hours to work on anything that relates to our products, and deliver it during ShipIt Day, our 24-hour hackathon.</span></p>
<p><iframe width="848" height="477" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVTcSwfICxo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What is the most awesome thing or project your company has done?</strong></p>
<p><span>We make awesome software products &#8211; Jira, Confluence, HipChat and BitBucket to name a few. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sponsors are a huge part of Hackagong. Without the generous contributions from our sponsors, we wouldn&#8217;t be running this awesome Hackathon! This is Sponsor Watch, where we take a quick look at one of our sponsors.</p>
<p><b>Company:</b> iAccelerate<br />
<strong>Company Website:</strong> <a class="in-cell-link" href="http://www.iaccelerate.com.au" target="_blank">www.iaccelerate.com.au<br />
</a><br />
<strong>Location:</strong></p>
<p>Currently in the Mike Codd Building, Level 1, on Innovation Campus, Squires Way, North Wollongong. We are moving into the iAccelerate Centre, the region&#8217;s first purpose-built high-tech incubator.</p>
<p>The three-story, 4,000 square metre iAccelerate Centre will feature ‘plug and go’ expandable space for more than 280 entrepreneurs at UOW’s Innovation Campus.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>What does your company do?</strong></p>
<p>iAccelerate is a University of Wollongong initiative that is tailored to help build and grow your business. The iAccelerate program is designed around a robust educational program, formalised business acceleration monitoring and one-to-one mentoring.</p>
<p>iAccelerate offers startups the unique opportunity to partner with a university comprising over 30,000 students, 2,000 staff and a significant portfolio of faculties and business units. UOW activities generate over $2 billion in economic activity each year and it is an extraordinary partner to have on your path to success.</p>
<p>iAccelerate utilises a multi-faceted approach to accelerating sustainable business growth to deliver the greatest economic impact. We offer a two stream program with up to a three-year incubation period &#8211; unique in the Australian startup landscape.</p>
<p><strong>How did your company first get started? </strong><strong>What&#8217;s the origin story?</strong></p>
<p>We got started with iAccelerate as we saw an untapped resource in the University and in the Illawarra region generally. We have a highly technical University in UOW and we have a passionate and proud community in the Illawarra region that is undergoing massive economic changes. The perfect recipe for change makers and innovators to bring about meaningful change and deliver a new future to the region.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you sponsor Hackagong 2015?</strong></p>
<p>This will be the 3rd year we have been a sponsor of Hackagong and as always we are excited and inspired by all things innovative.</p>
<p>We are keen to support all activities in the Illawarra that encourage creativity, thinking that challenges the status quo and building community. These are all things that Hackagong does so we will always be strong supporters of this event.</p>
<p><strong>Has your company ever held internal hackathons?</strong></p>
<p>We are an incubator / accelerator for Startup Businesses in the Illawarra, so there is a lot of Hacking going on with the iAccelerate Resident businesses.</p>
<p><strong>What is the most awesome thing or project your company has done?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Built an innovation ecosystem in the Illawarra from the ground up.<br />
Secured $16.5 Million to construct the iAccelerate Centre &#8211; the funding for the Centre was part of the Restart Illawarra Infrastructure Fund.</li>
<li></li>
<li>&#8211; Supported over 40 companies since launch<br />
&#8211; Created over 70 startup jobs<br />
&#8211; 45% of iAccelerate startups have a female co-founder<br />
&#8211; 10 Million seed fund approved by Innovation Australia</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s an internal/industry problem your company would like to solve?</strong></p>
<p>Economic diversity and prosperity in the Illawarra &#8211; provide the opportunity for the Illawarra to have a self determined future.</p>
<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to at Hackagong 2015?</strong></p>
<p>The amazing ideas that will come out of the weekend. The passion of the participants and the community it builds around innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Are you currently hiring and if so, what type of person are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently hiring &#8211; looking for COO for the new iAccelerate Centre: <a title="UOW Link" href="//uow.employment.com.au/jobs/Chief-Operating-Officer/1971">UoW Employment</a></p>
<p><strong>What trending technology are you most excited for over the next 5 years?</strong></p>
<p>Computing Everywhere &#8211; As smart-phone technology advances, smart-phones will be used in new contexts and environments. Along with wearables, smart-phones will offer connected screens in the workplace and in public. User experience will be key.</p>
<p>Internet of Things (IOT) &#8211; but lets think about it in the real value it brings and that is the awesome data IOT will bring into play. So it will be more the Internet of Data and meaningful to boot.</p>
<p>Hackagong and WITS thanks iAccelerate for supporting our event! Without them Hackagong would not be possible.</p>

<p><b>What if we can&#8217;t make it to DemoDay?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah it’s on a Friday to align with the MindShift event. If you’re in the Top 5 teams and can’t pitch on the day, you can either submit a video pitch which we will play on stage or we can Skype you in. Contact </span><a href="mailto:info@hackagong.com"><span style="font-weight: 400">info@hackagong.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for any issues or concerns.</span></p>
<p><b>What is crowdfunding? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crowdfunding is an awesome way to raise funds from a large group of people for a new project. KickStarter is the most well-known platform, famous for funding products such as the Pebble watch. However crowdfunding isn’t limited to physical consumer products. You can crowdfund anything. Many predict it will be the future of venture capital and startup financing.</span></p>
<p><b>Why are you being a meanie? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hackagong likes to try new things. It’s the reason why we’ve grown to become Australia’s largest hackathon in just 4 years. Our mission is to spark new innovations and maker communities, thus encouraging the formation of new startups in the Illawarra and Australia. The crowdfunding campaign requirement presents the following benefits:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Competitors rapidly learn invaluable sales and marketing skills.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crowdfunding is the ultimate validation of product-market fit. If people give you money, they really want the product.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Crowdfunding could potentially fund dozens of Hackagong team projects.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Encourages teams to continue working on their projects after Hackagong.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Provides an instant customer base and evangelised community.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Judging for the overall prize becomes much more efficient.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>What platform should I use?</b><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s your choice. There are 100s of platforms in the wild that cater to different niches and have varied funding models. Something like Indiegogo is likely a better choice than KickStarter for this scenario. Wikipedia has a good comparison of platforms: <a href="http://wki.pe/Comparison_of_crowdfunding_services">http://wki.pe/Comparison_of_crowdfunding_services</a></span></p>
<p><b>How much should we raise? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s entirely up to you. We’re not expecting million dollar crowdfunding campaigns. If you raise $1000, that’s pretty awesome right? It’s also up to you whether you choose to use a platform that returns money to backers if the funding goal is not reached (“All or Nothing”), or a platform where all funds are kept (“Keep it All”).</span></p>
<p><b>What perks shall I offer our backers? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have a look around at what perks other small crowdfunding campaigns offer their backers. You likely don’t want to be printing tshirts or anything complex. At the least you could simply offer backers beta access to the product, or a subscription, or some other small perk. Your backers are likely to be friends/family wanting to support you, and others who actually see value in the product to solve their problems. Cater perks to both.</span></p>
<p><b>What about the campaign video? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Videos are very important to a crowdfunding campaign. That doesn’t mean you need an expensive, high-production value video. Use your phone, add some basic editing, make it short, funny, interesting and clearly explain the pain-point you’re solving for backers and how the product solves that pain-point. If your video is less than 3min, is compelling enough to collect a new backer and a social share… perfect.</span></p>
<p><b>How to hustle and promote? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Learn fast, fail often. Brainstorm a list of things you could do, places to promote, people to contact, networks to leverage. Try them all. Test and measure. Whatever works best, keep doing that thing. There are also tonnes of resources online regarding tactics to promote crowdfunding campaigns.</span></p>
<p><b>How long should we run the campaign?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Usually you can set the timeframe yourself. Most campaigns run for 30 days.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">Since there are only 12 days between Hackagong and DemoDay, it makes sense to keep the campaign running for another ~18 days after DemoDay. We will promote all active campaigns at DemoDay and on all of our social channels.</span><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>What if we don&#8217;t meet our funding goal? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you set a reasonable funding goal and did the best you can to promote, perhaps it’s just validation that the market demand/want for your product wasn’t really there. Refund backers, get feedback from them and reflect on the learnings for the next campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>What if we don&#8217;t want to continue on the project? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No worries, just ensure your backers are kept in the loop and nobody is burned. Refund backers, keep them happy. Those very backers are now potential evangelists and customers for your next project.</span></p>
<p><b>What if we raise so much money that we can ditch our job/uni and go change the world?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Awesome epicness. To the moon!</span></p>

<p><b>Company:</b> <span>IMC Pacific</span><br />
<strong>Company Website:</strong> <span><a class="in-cell-link" href="http://imcgraduates.com.au" target="_blank">imcgraduates.com.au</a></span><br />
<strong>Location:</strong> <span>50 Bridge St, Sydney, 2000.</span><br />
<strong>Number of Employees:</strong> <span>90 in our Sydney office, over 400 globally.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What does your company do?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>IMC is one of the world&#8217;s leading proprietary trading firms, trading on the biggest exchanges in the world.<br />
We’re primarily active in algorithmic arbitrage and market-making on listed exchanges across the globe.<br />
Technology has transformed the old method of floor trading that you’ve seen in the movies to a process where traders are &#8216;plugged in&#8217; to exchanges. We’re leading this transition. Our trading strategy involves using sophisticated algorithms, which are created and coded by us, to buy and sell a security at different prices. It creates a unique environment where traders and developers work as one team to apply technology in new and innovative ways</span></p>
<p><strong>How did your company first get started? </strong><strong>What&#8217;s the origin story?</strong></p>
<p><span>IMC was founded in 1989 by two Dutch traders.</span></p>

<p><span>To meet talented software developers.</span></p>
<p><strong>Has your company ever held internal hackathons?</strong></p>
<p>No</p>
<p><strong>What is the most awesome thing or project your company has done?</strong></p>
<p><span>At IMC we have designed one of the worlds fastest trading systems. It is an extremely competitive industry. Our systems are so finely tuned that performance changes on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds are detectable, and relevant.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s an internal/industry problem your company would like to solve?</strong></p>
<p><span>IMC is on the forefront of automated trading. One of our biggest challenges relates to processing huge volumes of data from different geographical locations with minimal latency. This provides many challenges, where networking, software design and hardware are all critical components which must work together with high precision.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are you most looking forward to at Hackagong 2015?</strong></p>
<p><span>Keen, energetic software developers working with a fixed deadline, using new technologies to solve creative problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>Are you currently hiring and if so, what type of person are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes- We are looking for the smartest and most exceptional graduates to join our team. People who want to work collaboratively, be challenged every day, can think fast and solve complex problems, constantly innovate and, importantly, enjoy what they do!</span></p>
<p>Apply for our 2016 Graduate Program if you:</p>
<p>• You are a final year student in a technical discipline (e.g. IT, Business Information Systems/Technology or Computer Science). Other degree qualifications will be considered if supported by strong IT components.<br />
• You possess a strong knowledge of algorithms and data structures.<br />
• Excellent programming skills and development experience.<br />
• You demonstrate high-achievement, both academically (with at least the equivalent of a Distinction average).<br />
• Achievement in extra-curricular activities, such as sports, community or volunteer work, running a business, etc.</p>
<p>http://imcgraduates.com.au/</p>
<p><span><strong>What trending technology are you most excited for over the next 5 years?</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the recent technologies which are of interest are:</span></p>
<p>• Hadoop and the other Big Data systems.<br />
• FPGA and custom hardware design.</p>
<p>Hackagong and WITS thanks IMC for supporting our event! Without them Hackagong would not be possible.</p>
